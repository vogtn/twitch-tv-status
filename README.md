####The purpose of this app is to use the TwitchTv api to create a status indicator for various streamers on Twitch. This utilizes: 

   *javascript
   
   *CSS
   
   *HTML(Bootstrap)
   
   *jQuery
   
   *JSON

What I learned: 
  1. How to use JSON to grab location services from the browser (and ultimately the user) 
  2. Differences in how groups handle API docs. I found the openweathermap api much easier to manipulate and pull. Much of the syntax relating to grabbing user information
  became a welcome, but trying challenge. 
  3. Utilizing Math.round();
